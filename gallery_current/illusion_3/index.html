				<h2>How do color, shape, and illumination work collectively or against each other in Vasarely's 'Nested Squares' Illusion? </h2>
				<span class="byline">Jessica Boye-Doe and Jazhara Solan</span> </div>

				<p>
					Vasarely's 'Nested Squares' Illusion involves grayscale squares of increasing luminance  placed on top of each other and the 
					result of this is the perception of a glowing X from the diagonals of the squares; each square has only one illumination so 
					this glowing X does not really exist. Our illusion tests the effects of color and shape on Vasarely's 'Nested Squares' 
					Illusion. We predicted that color would allow the illusory contours to be less strong especially if the color is changed. 
					We predicted that shape would get rid of the illusion entirely because of the lack of corners given that “sharp corners are 
					more salient than shallow corners” for this illusion (Troncoso, 2005). We wanted to see the effect of gradual changes in 
					color, subtle change in color (close to no change by using one-color gradients), and abrupt changes in color. We then wanted
					 to see if change of shape combined with change of color would have an effect.
				</p>
				<p>
					The results show that when the image is a square and when there is a gradual or subtle change in color the nested square 
					illusion is still consistent. When there is an abrupt change in color the bright diagonals can still be seen but not as 
					much as in the other variations of the illusion because the illumination goes from light to dark then dark to light. When the shape changes the illusion breaks completely even with the 
					grayscale image, but a new perception is found. When there is a gradual change in color, the circular image outskirts look 
					less defined and give some aerial perspective since the outskirts are also bluer than the center. When the color changes 
					subtly over the pink gradient we perceive a 3D shape making the image look close to an eye, while with the subtle blue 
					gradient the resulting image appears like a blob also outlining the impact of aerial perspective having things that are 
					bluer and blurrier seem further in the distance and less defined. The most interesting result is based on abrupt color 
					change with the concentric circles. The abrupt change causes shape from shading as we can perceive a red sphere on a blue 
					background very clearly and this has to do with our abrupt color change including black just before the darkest red of the gradient making it seem like there is a dark 
					outline of the red circles and a dark red shadow distinguishing it from the blue ones to make a sphere. Our results show that color 
					itself does not break the illusory contours created by change in illumination and corners but a combination of shape and 
					color does provide different means for different illusory effects. Color takes over when shape is less defined while shape 
					takes over otherwise with the illumination complimenting effects of either parameter.
