				<h2>How does the perceived speed of moving gratings compare when simultaneously viewing gratings in the center and periphery?</h2>
				<span class="byline">Alisa Hathaway, Christopher Wang, Nico van Wijk</span> </div>

				<p>For this illusion, you will view pairs of moving gratings that share the same speed. Look directly at one grating at a time, keeping the other in the periphery, and alternate between the two gratings every few seconds. Note whether the grating in the periphery appears to be moving faster or slower than the one in the visual field center. We recommend that all demonstrations below are viewed in full screen for maximum effect. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					We initially hypothesized that the grating in the periphery would appear to be moving more slowly than the grating in the center. Since the periphery has lower resolution, we expected perception of peripheral gradients to be more noisy and thus rely more heavily on the brain's prior favoring slow speeds, as discussed in class.
					<br/>
					<br/> 
					Demos 1, 2, and 3 contain two gratings moving horizontally. In 1, they move in the same direction, and in 2 and 3, they move in opposite directions. For each demo, if you focus on one grating while keeping the other in your periphery, how do the two speeds compare? Notably, we observed a surprising effect in demos 2-3 that we did not see in demo 1; do you see it?

				<p>We perceived the speeds to be the same when the gratings were moving in the same direction (demo 1), but when the gratings were moving in opposite directions (demos 2-3), contrary to our hypothesis, we found the grating in the periphery to move faster than the one in the center! If we rotate the gratings so that they move vertically, do you still observe a similar difference when the gratings move in the same direction (demo 4) vs. in opposite directions (demo 5)?</p>

				<p>If the two gratings are moving perpendicularly to each other (demo 6), do you still notice a difference in their speeds? Additionally, we hypothesized that the observed effect could be caused by subconscious eye tracking of the moving grating in the visual field center. To test this, we added a red dot in the center of each grating (demo 7). If you fixate on the red dot when focusing on each grating, does the effect continue to persist?</p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
					<br/>
					<p>We discovered that a grating in the periphery would appear to move faster than a grating in the center if the two gratings were moving in opposite directions. This observation provided evidence against our initial hypothesis that the gratings in the periphery would appear to move slower (which we thought would be independent of the direction of motion). We speculate that, if we reduced the contrast of the gratings (e.g. increased the noise further), the prior for slow speeds might influence peripheral vision more heavily, reducing the perceived speed of the peripheral gradient.</p>
					<p>The inclusion of the red dots in demo 7 removed subconscious eye tracking of the moving grating in the visual field center. Since we observed the effect to be significantly weakened in demo 7, we now hypothesize that this effect is (at least partly) caused by subconscious eye tracking of the moving grating in the visual field center, which causes the grating in the periphery to seem like it is moving faster than it actually is. This is consistent with the fact that we observed the effect most strongly in demos 2, 3, and 5 (gratings moving in opposite directions), whereas we found the effect to be weakened in demo 6 when the gratings moved perpendicularly. However, if the effect is caused by subconscious eye tracking, we find it surprising that the perceived change in speed is not canceled out by efference copies.</p>
					<p>If you observed something different than we did, we encourage you to share your experience below!</p>
