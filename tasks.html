				<h2>Visual illusion lab: tasks</h2>
				<span class="byline">Steps to take to complete the lab</span> </div>

			<div class="subtitle">
				<h3 id="task1">1. Review existing illusions</h3>
				<span class="byline">Due before your illusion meeting</span> </div>

			<p>For each example in the <a href="./review.html">illusion review</a>, write a sentence that briefly describes what perceptual principle is being demonstrated and what kinds of perceptual processing and phenomena are involved in the demo design (think in terms of class topics/concepts). Submit your answers <a href="https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/19668/assignments/269876">on Canvas</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Example for one of the listed illusions (which?):</strong> "This illusion relies on combining stereopsis and color perception to show that perceived color relies on perceived depth."</p><br>


			<div class="subtitle">
				<h3 id="task2">2. Meet with course staff</h3>
				<span class="byline">Meeting period: April 28 to May 05 </span></div>
				<p>Come up with a idea for making an illusion that answers a new scientific question about perception.
					This illusion should be inspired by at least one of the papers on the list (check with the course staff if you want to use something outside of the list).
					Attend a meeting with one of the course staff to discuss the idea(s).
					It is strongly advised to have an initial illusion design/sketch to discuss (even if you haven't created the illusion itself).
					Following your meeting, submit a meeting summary <a href="https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/19668/assignments/269873">on Canvas</a>.
				</p>

			<div class="subtitle">
				<h3 id="task3">3. Design & submit your illusion</h3>
				<span class="byline">Due Monday May 08, 11:59PM</span> </div>

				<p> Fill in the html template on the <a href="./resources.html">Resources</a> page to design your webpage. Feel free to personalize it as much as you want, as long as it clearly includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li> A new scientific question that your illusion is meant to address</li>
						<li> An explanation of your illusion design, and how it is meant to address your question</li>
						<li> Your illusion: one or more than one image, gif, or video for others to view</li>
						<li> The citation to the paper(s) that inspired your illusion </li>
						<li> A picture for the gallery homepage</li>
					</ul>

			<p> Please keep in mind that this webpage is for others to read and understand your illusion: to aid in this, your writing should discuss concepts covered in class. Create a zip folder with all of the necessary components and submit it <a href="https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/19668/assignments/269877">on Canvas</a>.</p><br>

			<div class="subtitle">
				<h3 id="task4">4. Gallery Exchange</h3>
				<span class="byline">Part a & b) Due Wednesday May 10, 11:59PM, part c & d) Friday May 06, 11:59PM </span> </div>

			<p>You will be assigned two of your classmates' submissions in the gallery. On each, leave a 2-3 sentence comment that covers the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a) Pretend you are a research subject participating in your classmate's experiment. Describe your subjective experience of the illusion.</li>
				<li>b) Now, pretend you are the researcher and assess whether your experience of the demo was helpful in answering the stated question.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Make sure to include your name. Feel free to include comments on other illusions as well!</p>
			<p>On your own illusion page, respond to the comments by your classmates. Pretending you are the researcher,</p>
			<ul>
				<li>c) Assess whether the subjective reports answer your question</li>
				<li>d) Identify what changes you could make to your illusion to get a clearer answer to your question; OR, ask a follow-up question based on the answer you've arrived at.</li>
			</ul><br>

			<div class="subtitle">
				<h3 id="task5">5. Feedback</h3>
				<span class="byline">Due Friday May 12, 11:59PM </span> </div>
				<p> <a href="https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/19668/assignments/269880">On Canvas</a>, submit a response to tell us at least one way we could improve this assignment. Thanks!</p>
